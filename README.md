# Real-Time CPU Scheduler Simulator (FCFS)

This project is a **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) CPU Scheduler Simulator** built using **Streamlit**. It allows users to simulate real-time process scheduling, visualize execution order, and analyze scheduling performance.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… **FCFS Scheduling Simulation**  
  - Sorts processes based on arrival time.  
  - Simulates execution in real-time with live updates.  
  - Computes **Completion Time, Turnaround Time, and Waiting Time**.  

- âœ… **Live Execution Order**  
  - Displays which process is currently executing.  
  - Shows **progressive execution** with **real-time status updates**.  

- âœ… **Gantt Chart Visualization**  
  - Graphical representation of process execution order.  
  - Helps in understanding scheduling behavior.  

- âœ… **Create a Real OS Process**  
  - Simulates an actual **operating system process** running for 3 seconds.
